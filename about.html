            <div class="hobbies">
                <p>  My name is Marcela Passos. I am a second year student at the University of Michigan. I am double majoring in Art and Design and SI with a focus in UX/UI design.
                    I work primarily in digital mediums using software like procreate and adobe photoshop and illustrator. My family is from Brazil and I take pride in my latin herritage.
                     I love all kinds of music from rap and rnb to indie rock and bosa nova. In my free time I'm often rock climbing or exploring the outdoors. <br></br>

                    <p>  Here I am on the beach in Mexico! I absolutely love swimming in the ocean and reading on the beach.</p>

                    <p>  My strengths are being compassionate, a team player, flexibility, curiosity, creativity, and enthusiasm But I can also be unrealistic and impatient at times.</p>

                    <p>  I climbed my first outdoor 5.11 in the fall of 2022.</p>

                    <p>  Music is another passion of mine, singing as a part of a Choir for the past 8 years. Additionally, I was a theater kid in middle and high school and Hamilton happens to be one of my guilty pleasures. For my 19th birthday, my dad took me to see Hamilton and The Book of Mormon on Broadway.</p>

                    <p>  I started climbing seriously Spring of 2022 and haven't looked back since. I've met some of the most amazing people through the Michigan Climbing Club.</p>

                    <p>  I have a little devil dog named Hilda. She's so sweet but also an absolute menace. Because of her minute size, she seems to have to overcompensate with her incesant barking. Even so, I love her with all my heart.</p>

                    <p>  I went Bouldering (climbing without ropes and using crash pads) in Utah and experienced the most beutiful sunset of my life.</p>
